  abstract={The proliferation of commodity devices for gathering health data has led to multimodal health trackers that provide increasingly
holistic views of people's well-being. As these trackers become more complex, it becomes harder for users to interpret how
different signals interrelate in order to derive actionable insights and make informed health decisions. Addressing this
challenge first requires understanding the cognitive and behavioral processes through which users interpret and make
sense of multimodal data. In this paper, we use menstrual health tracking as a case study for investigating how individuals
interpret multimodal health data. We conducted a 100-day longitudinal study with 20 participants who used a variety of
health trackers to monitor signals relevant to menstrual health (e.g., hormones, sleep, mood). Through surveys and interviews,
we identified that participants aligned their health goals with each device's perceived scope and approached multimodal data
with hypotheses that involved pairs of signals. Our findings shed light on how a person's confidence in the sensemaking
processes shapes their engagement with multimodality, leading to design recommendations that scaffold trust between users
and their devices while encouraging exploration and staying true to users' evolving health goals.},

abstract={Consumer devices are increasingly used to monitor peripheral body temperature (PBT) for menstrual cycle tracking, but the link between PBT and hormone variations remains underexplored. This study examines the relationship between these variables with a focus on nightly wrist skin temperature (WST). Fifty participants provided physiological and self-reported data, including WST, daily step counts, glucose levels, hormone levels (E3G, LH), and diary entries. Results show a negative correlation between WST and hormone levels when E3G and LH are below average, and this trend was robust to demographics and self-reported stress. Increased variance between mid-cycle hormonal peaks and WST fluctuations may stem from differences between basal body temperature (BBT) and WST. This research suggests that algorithms reliant on body temperature for tracking hormonal changes or other aspects of the menstrual cycle may need to account for increased variance in WST trends if they are meant to be deployed on wearable devices.},

  abstract={Previous menstrual health literature highlights a variety of signals not included in existing menstrual trackers because they are either difficult to gather or are not typically associated with menstrual health. Since it has become increasingly convenient to collect biomarkers through wearables and other consumer-grade devices, our work examines how people incorporate unconventional signals (e.g., blood glucose levels, heart rate) into their understanding of menstrual health. In this paper, we describe a three-month-long study on fifty participants’ experiences as they tracked their health using physiological sensors and daily diaries. We analyzed their experiences with both conventional and unconventional menstrual health signals through surveys and interviews conducted throughout the study. We delve into the various aspects of menstrual health that participants sought to affirm using unconventional signals, explore how these signals influenced their daily behaviors,and examine how multimodal menstrual tracking expanded their scope of menstrual health. Finally, we provide design recommendations for future multimodal menstrual trackers.},

abstract = {Menstrual trackers currently lack the affordances required to help individuals achieve their goals beyond menstrual event predictions and symptom logging. Taking an initial step towards this aspiration, we propose, validate, and refine five functional design requirements for future interface designs that facilitate menstrual data exploration. We interviewed 30 individuals who menstruate and collected their feedback on the practical application of these requirements. To elicit ideas and impressions, we designed two proof-of-concept interfaces to use as design probes with similar core functionalities but different presentations of phase timing predictions and signal arrangement. Our analysis revealed participants’ feedback regarding the presentation of predictions for menstrual-related events, the visualization of future signal patterns, personalization abilities for viewing signals relevant to their menstrual experience, the availability of resources to understand the underlying biological connections between signals, and the ability to compare multiple cycles side-by-side with context.},

  abstract={Past studies on how blood glucose levels vary across the menstrual cycle have largely shown inconsistent results based on limited blood draws. In this study, 49 individuals wore a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor and a Fitbit Sense smartwatch while measuring their menstrual hormones and self-reporting characteristics of their menstrual cycles daily. The average duration of participation was 79.3±21.2 days, leading to a total of 149 cycles and 554 phases in our dataset. We use periodic restricted cubic splines to evaluate the relationship between blood glucose and the menstrual cycle, after which we assess phase-based changes in daily median glucose level and associated physiological parameters using mixed-effects models. Results indicate that daily median glucose levels increase and decrease in a biphasic pattern, with maximum levels occurring during the luteal phase and minimum levels occurring during the late-follicular phase. These trends are robust to adjustments for participant characteristics (e.g., age, BMI, weight) and self-reported menstrual experiences (e.g., food cravings, bloating, fatigue). We identify negative associations between each of daily estrogen level, step count, and low degrees of fatigue with higher median glucose levels. Conversely, we find positive associations between higher food cravings and higher median glucose levels. This study suggests that blood glucose could be an important parameter for understanding menstrual health, prompting further investigation into how the menstrual cycle influences glucose fluctuation.}

  abstract={Following along how-to videos requires alternating focus between understanding procedural video instructions and performing them. Examining how to support these continuous context switches for the user has been largely unexplored. In this paper, we describe a user study with thirty participants who performed an hour-long cooking task while interacting with a wizard-of-oz hands-free interactive system that is aware of both their cooking progress and environment contexts. Through analysis of the session scripts, we identify a dichotomy between participant query differences and workflow alignment similarities, under-studied interactions that require AI functionality beyond video navigation alone, and queries that call for multimodal sensing of a user’s environment. By understanding the assistant experience through the participants’ interactions, we identify design implications for a smart assistant that can discern a user’s task completion flow and personal characteristics, accommodate requests within and external to the task domain, andsupport nonvoice-based queries.}

  abstract={Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on menstrual tracking has emphasized the need for more inclusive design of mechanisms for tracking and sharing information on menstruation. We investigate menstrual tracking and data-sharing attitudes and practices in educated, young (20-30 years old) menstruating individuals based in the United States, with self-identified minimal menstrual education backgrounds. Using interviews (N=18), a survey (N=62), and participatory design (N=7), we find that existing mechanisms for tracking and sharing data on menstruation are not adequately responsive to the needs of those who seek relevant menstrual education, are not in the sexual majority, and/or wish to customize what menstrual data they share and with whom. Our analysis highlights a design gap for participants with minimal sexual education backgrounds who wish to better understand their cycles. We also contribute a deepened understanding of structural health inequities that impact menstrual tracking and sharing practices, making recommendations for technology-mediated menstrual care.}

  abstract={Where should a HWD be placed in a user’s visual field? We present two studies that compare comfort, preference, task efficiency and accuracy for various HWD positions. The first study offsets a 9.2° horizontal field-of-view (FOV) display temporally (toward the ear) from 0° to 30° in 10° steps. 30° proves too uncomfortable while 10° is the most preferred position for a simple button-pushing game, corroborating results from previous single-task reading experiments. The second experiment uses a Magic Leap One to compare 10° x 10° FOV interfaces centered at line-of-sight, temporally offset 15° (center-right), inferiorly offset 15° (bottom-center), and offset in both directions (bottom-right) for an order picking task. The bottom-right position proved worst in terms of accuracy and several subjective metrics when compared to the line-of-sight position.}

  abstract={Head-worn displays (HWDs) are an efficient and cost-effective means to guide users in order picking, a task that requires users to alternate their attention between the physical environment and the HWD’s virtual image. After training 12 participants to expertise in picking, we compare three significantly different HWDs: Magic Leap One, Microsoft Hololens, and Google Glass Explorer Edition against paper pick lists (the industry standard). We find that previous findings on HWD benefits during such tasks are not reflected in all HWDs, suggesting that hardware design significantly influences efficacy. Based on experimental results and observations, we highlight challenges such as head weight, mounting, display clarity, field of view (FOV), and display position and discuss their possible effects on user comfort, user preference, task speed, and task accuracy.}

Speech recognition coupled with a head-worn display (HWD) may aid in awareness of when someone calls the user’s name. As our intended users are often oversubscribed with experiments, we chose to test non-deaf and hard of hearing subjects while refining our procedures. Preliminary findings from three hearing participants wearing sound masking headphones and performing a mobile task suggest that a HWD display may be faster than, and preferred to, a smartphone for displaying captions for attending to one’s name being called.}
