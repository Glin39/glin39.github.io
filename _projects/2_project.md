The World Health Organization estimates that by 2050, 1 in every 10 will have “disabling hearing loss”.  Captioning on Google Glass (CoG) is a project to provide real-time captioning.


`Towards an Understanding of Real-time Captioning on Head-worn Displays (HWD)`
As an extension of previous work that showed the potential HWDs could have for real-time captioning, we came up with multiple iterations for studies comparing HWDs (eg. Vuzix Blade, Google Glass) with mobile phones captioning. In this study, we compared the two during a stationary, instructional task assembling blocks. 

`Conversational greeting detection using captioning on head worn displays versus smartphones`
Ostrove et. al. found that over half of DHH students’ negative school experiences were due to not hearing something, such as a spoken name, and getting in trouble. In this study, we focus on providing better name awareness while on-the-go. Participants navigate an office building while responding to their name popping up on either the Google Glass or mobile phone.
