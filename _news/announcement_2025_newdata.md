I have released our new dataset: [mcPHASES: A Dataset of Physiological, Hormonal, and Self-reported Events and Symptoms for Menstrual Health Tracking with Wearables](https://physionet.org/content/mcphases/1.0.0/) on PhysioNet, one of the first to include hormone, wearable, and metabolic data for individuals who menstruate.
