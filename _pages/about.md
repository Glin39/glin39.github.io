I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Columbia University working with  [Xuhai "Orson" Xu](https://orsonxu.com/) and [Noémie Elhadad](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profile/noemie-elhadad/) on multi-agent systems for Women's health.

I prioritize building tools that enhance user agency and facilitate informed decisions about well-being in everyday contexts. This involves applying my expertise in `human-computer interaction`, `AI`, `machine learning`, `statistical methods`, and `human physiology` to a range of challenges, from designing novel multimodal health trackers to developing LLM-based agents for personalized goal creation and fulfillment.

I recieved my doctorate  at the University of Toronto, advised by [Khai N. Truong](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Alex Mariakakis](https://mariakakis.github.io/), where I focused on understanding how individuals engage with complex, multimodal personal data and developing user-centered designs and systems to help people navigate uncertainty and align tools with their diverse mental models. Previously, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology where I worked with [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/).  

I am honored to have received several notable awards, including the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/), Wolfond Fellowship, and [GVU Distinguished Masters Student Award](https://gvu.gatech.edu/gvu-graduate-student-awards-program-2020).
