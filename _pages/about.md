<p style="color:#1e90ff; font-weight:bold;">
  I am on the job market this year looking for industry research positions (e.g., Research Scientist). 
  <a href="assets/pdf/Blue_CV.pdf" style="color:#1e90ff; font-weight:bold;">Here is my CV</a>. Please reach out ðŸ˜Š
</p>

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by [Khai N. Truong](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Alex Mariakakis](https://mariakakis.github.io/) and a student researcher at [Google Health](https://health.google/health-research/). I focus on understanding how individuals engage with complex, multimodal personal data and developing user-centered designs and systems to help people navigate uncertainty and align tools with their diverse mental models.

I prioritize building tools that enhance user agency and facilitate informed decisions about well-being in everyday contexts. This involves applying my expertise in `human-computer interaction`, `machine learning`, `statistical methods`, and `human physiology` to a range of challenges, from designing novel multimodal health trackers to developing LLM-based agents for personalized goal creation and fulfillment.

Previously, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology where I worked with [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/).  I am honored to have received several notable awards, including the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/), Wolfond Fellowship, and [GVU Distinguished Masters Student Award](https://gvu.gatech.edu/gvu-graduate-student-awards-program-2020).
