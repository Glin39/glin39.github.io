I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a student researcher at [Google Health](https://health.google/health-research/). I currently work on `health sensing techniques` and `user-centered designs for health applications`, advised by [Khai N. Truong](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Alex Mariakakis](https://mariakakis.github.io/). I am particularly passionate about understanding how consumer health devices can bridge the gap between raw health data and deeper insights into our well-being, especially for populations that have historically been underserved by traditional healthcare systems and technologies. By integrating multimodal health sensing techniques, I aim to design tools that enhance user agency and help individuals make informed decisions about their well-being in everyday contexts.

Previously, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology where I worked with [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/).  I am honored to have received several notable awards, including the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/), Wolfond Fellowship, and [GVU Distinguished Masters Student Award](https://gvu.gatech.edu/gvu-graduate-student-awards-program-2020).
