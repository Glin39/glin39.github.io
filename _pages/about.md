I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a student researcher at [Google Health](https://health.google/health-research/). I currently work on `health sensing techniques` and `user-centered designs for health applications`, advised by [Khai N. Truong](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Alex Mariakakis](https://mariakakis.github.io/).  I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology]() where I worked with [Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/) and [Neha Kumar](https://www.nehakumar.org/).  I am honored to have received several notable awards, including the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/), Wolfond Fellowship, and [GVU Distinguished Masters Student Award](https://gvu.gatech.edu/gvu-graduate-student-awards-program-2020).
